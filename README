This is a console application that uses the `iching` library to perform a
reading of the I Ching.

To use it, build the package with `go build` and run the resulting
`iching_console` program from the terminal. You will be asked a question, then
the program will randomly generate, using the three-coin method, six lines that
form a hexagram. If any of the lines are "changing," the program will print the
hexagram they are changing into.

You will also be given a couple of links to well-known translations of the text
pertaining to both the current and changing hexagram.
